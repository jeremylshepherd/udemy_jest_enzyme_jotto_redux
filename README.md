# Second project in [2021 Update! React Testing with Jest and Enzyme](https://www.udemy.com/course-dashboard-redirect/?course_id=1719174)

This project is a simple Word Guessing game project. The course 2 implementations of the game one using redux the other using the Context API. This is the Redux version. 

I am using TypeScript in lieu of Vanilla JavaScript. Any issues I encounter using TS, I will document with comments in the code itself (the problem and *hopefully* the solution).
